                        <h3>Dear Love,</h3>
                        <p>Each day has been wonderful ever since you came to my life. Not being able to talk to you feels like my day is incomplete. Meeting you was such an unexpected blessing to me, I have prayed for times that I will meet someone who will love me like the way I do. Now that I found you, I’ve realized that I can still trust and love someone again. If I have to describe you, you were like a hidden gem to me, rare and one of a kind. Before meeting you, I found peace in my own company. Love can hurt you to the point that you’d prefer taking your path alone rather than having someone that causes you chaos. Though my perception of love was changed when I found you. There are times when I feel lost and down but somehow, I end my day with a smile, your existence and voice are enough to make me happy. Being with you feels like I can achieve everything and surpass any challenges.
                        </p>
                        <p>I know that some might say we are too young to be this serious but that’s how love is supposed to be. I do take you seriously and I truly want to see us together in the future. I’m so blessed that the mom of my kids will be a kind and soft-hearted person. I know that you will be a great mom for our kids and our kids would proudly say that they have the best mom in the whole universe. You might be worried that I might find someone closer to me or find someone you think who’s more beautiful than you but trust me, no one compares to you. In my eyes, you are the most beautiful and adorable girl I have ever known. Our long distance will not be forever, we’re gonna plan out things together in the near future. For now, let’s endure the hardships and face the challenges side by side. Whenever you are feeling down and having a bad day, don’t forget that you have me and you can always lean on me. A shared sorrow makes it a half sorrow. Remember that we are one, when you’re sad it makes me sad too, when you’re happy I am happy as well. Through ups and down, we will always take on everything together. I want to be the person who makes you feel loved, cared for and the one who creates a safe space where you can express yourself comfortably. Words aren’t enough to say that I really love you, so I’d like to ask for your permission…</p>
